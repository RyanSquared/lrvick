You can say what you want about WikiLeaks and groups like it. You can hate them or love them. Any human being has a right to morally judge for themselves if they are pro or anti WikiLeaks. I do however firmly believe that every human being has a moral obligation to be anti-anti-WikiLeaks. Once their right to free speech is taken, yours is next.

Times are changing at an exponential rate. Movies once physically bought in stores are now downloaded or streamed online for free. Musical artists that once would sue over their music being downloaded are now offering downloads themselves.

This is the age of the internet. An age where knowledge truly is power, and precious stones and metals are merely decoration. It is the wild wild west all over again but where once people smuggled their whiskey in boots across borders and sent messages by pony express, we now smuggle pirated media and software to anyone with a computer, and send messages to the entire world with the click of a button. Even money has become digital, with only a fraction of the money in the world still existing in physical form, the rest being just digits in clusters of mainframe computers.

Despite all of this, many are set in the old ways. Why? Because secrets are best hidden in the darkness, and there is no place for that in a digital age, where any bit of information obtained is copied endlessly and shared with the world. Yes, there are still many fighting to keep the control that the availability and accountability this new information age is taking away from them. Groups like wikileaks, are not making them very happy.

Many are watching the news and spreading how our troops are going to die, and that a war is going to start over the information being leaked around. Many of the newspapers and media would tell you that information is dangerous and that you should plug your ears. I will refrain from naming names, however with a bit of research you will find some of the government officials saying that the wikileaks team should be hunt down and killed... might be doing so with alterer motives. Some of the officials that have been nosiest about silencing wikileaks, coincidentally have not had much to say about the fact some of the leaked documents are about them.

If I can encourage you to do anything it is to reserve judgement until you have all the facts, and once you have said facts, take the responsibility upon yourself to share them with others.

I will leave you with a quote from House Representative Ron Paul, whom when asked about WikiLeaks and free speech had the following to say:

"In a free society, we are supposed to know the truth. In a society where truth becomes treason, we are in big trouble."
